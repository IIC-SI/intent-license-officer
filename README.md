# Intent License Officer (ILO)

The **Intent License Officer (ILO)** is an ethical intent-evaluation framework for AI systems.
It assesses **human intent**, accountability, and moral readiness before granting an **Intent License Certificate** for AI deployment.

This repository contains:
- Public doctrine and ethical framework
- The official 45-question Intent Validation Test
- Governance, registry, and certificate templates
- Automation scripts and documentation

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT  
> This repository does **NOT** grant legal authority.  
> The Intent License is an **ethical attestation**, not a regulatory approval.

## What This Is

- A **non-governmental ethical gatekeeping system**

- A **deliberately difficult process** designed to resist gaming

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not a legal license
- Not a safety guarantee
- Not a certification of correctness
- Not a shortcut to deployment
